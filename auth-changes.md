# Authentication System Changes

## Overview
We have simplified the authentication system by replacing AWS Cognito with a simple JWT-based authentication system.

## Changes Made

### Initial Cleanup

1. **Removed Cognito Dependencies**
   - Removed AWS Cognito SDK
   - Removed CognitoService and related model classes
   - Eliminated unnecessary AWS credentials requirements

2. **Simplified Authentication**
   - Created a simple in-memory AuthService
   - Implemented JWT token generation and validation
   - Added role-based access control

3. **Streamlined Session Management**
   - Removed complex scope caching mechanisms
   - Simplified session validation
   - Implemented proper token invalidation on logout
   - Separated token validation and user authentication concerns

### Additional Cleanup

4. **Complete Removal of AWS Cognito**
   - Deleted CognitoService.java and marked for removal
   - Removed CognitoPoolConfig.java and other Cognito-related classes
   - Eliminated JwkUtil.java which was used for Cognito JWT validation

5. **Simplified Session Service**
   - Removed all Cognito references from SessionService
   - Refactored to use simple JWT validation
   - Removed unnecessary CachedScopes implementation

4. **Improved Security Configuration**
   - Added a JwtAuthFilter for token validation
   - Set up Spring Security with proper configurations
   - Implemented CORS settings

## New Authentication Flow

1. **Login**
   - User submits username and password
   - Server validates credentials
   - JWT token is generated and returned
   - Token is stored as an HTTP-only cookie and in the Authorization header

2. **Authorization**
   - All secured endpoints require a valid JWT
   - Token can be provided in Authorization header or as a cookie
   - Role-based access is enforced through Spring Security

3. **Session Validation**
   - Client can validate sessions by calling the /session endpoint
   - Expired or invalid tokens result in 401 responses

## Sample Users for Development

| Username | Password    | Role    |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| admin    | admin123    | ADMIN   |
| user     | user123     | USER    |
| creator  | creator123  | CREATOR |

## Next Steps

1. **Database Integration**
   - Replace in-memory user store with database
   - Implement proper password hashing
   - Add user registration and management features

2. **Enhanced Security**
   - Implement refresh tokens
   - Add rate limiting
   - Implement account lockout after failed attempts

3. **User Management**
   - Add user profile management
   - Implement password reset flows
   - Add email verification
